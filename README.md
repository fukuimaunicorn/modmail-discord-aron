    This is an open source discord bot made by kyb3r and improved upon suggestions by the users! This bot enables server members to DM it, the messages then get relayed to the server moderators who can then respond through the bot. In essence this bot serves as a means for members to easily communicate with server leadership in an organised manner.

## How does it work?

Assuming you got the bot setup (Read below on how to set it up), the first thing that you would do is type the command ```<prefix>setup [modrole]``` where `[modrole]` is an optional role you can specify which determines who can see the relayed messages. If a role is not specified, the bot will choose the first role that has `manage guild` permissions as the modrole. The bot will then set up a channel category named `Mod Mail`.

When a user sends a direct message to the bot, a channel is created within this new category. This channel is where messages will be relayed. To reply to a message, simply type the command `<prefix>reply <message>` in the channel.

## Hosting on Heroku
### What is Heroku?
Heroku is a free hosting site that can host many web apps. However, the web apps cannot store any data on site (changing files). We have made Mod Mail to do exactly that. It was made to be *stateless* and not store any data in json files or any other storage files.

### How do I do it?
If you choose to install the bot using Heroku, you do not need to download anything. In fact, you can set it all up on a phone!

### Heroku Account

You need to make a Heroku account. Make one at [Heroku's Website](https://heroku.com/) and then follow the steps below:

### Creating a bot account

1. Create a Bot Application for Discord
2. Head over to the [applicatons page](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me).
3. Click “new application”. Give it a name, picture and description.
4. Click “Create Bot User” and click “Yes, Do It!” when the dialog pops up.
5. Copy down the bot token. This is what is used to login to your bot and will be used at Step 8, or 11 if you are setting up on your PC. [Here's a GIF to explain the first 5 steps](https://i.imgur.com/Y2ouW7I.gif)

### Deploying the bot
[![Deploy](https://www.herokucdn.com/deploy/button.png)](https://heroku.com/deploy)

1. Click the button above
2. Input a name of your choosing for your app, the heroku app name is not important.
3. Input your bot token into the `TOKEN` field.
4. Put the [ID of your Server](https://support.discordapp.com/hc/en-us/articles/206346498-Where-can-I-find-my-User-Server-Message-ID-) into the `GUILD_ID` field.
5. Put the command prefix you want in the `PREFIX` field. e.g `?` The default prefix is `m.`
6. Click the `deploy app` button and wait for it to finish.
7. Click `manage app` and go into the `resources` tab.
8. Now turn on the worker by clicking the pencil icon.
9. If you want, you can go over and check the application logs to see if everything is running smoothly.
10. Once the bot is online in your server, do `[your prefix]setup` and you are good to go!

You can add the bot to your server with [this tool](https://finitereality.github.io/permissions-calculator/?v=0). Your Client ID is retrived from the [applicatons page](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me)

Now you should be done. Go over to discord and try it out! If you have any issues, join the [discord server](https://kybr.tk/discord).

**Make sure to give the bot Manage Channels and Manage Messages permissions!**
